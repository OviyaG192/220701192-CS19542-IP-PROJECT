                <h3>The Future of Education: Virtual Classrooms or In-Person Learning?</h3>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reshaped the way education is delivered worldwide. Schools, colleges, 
                   and universities rapidly adopted virtual classrooms to ensure continuity in learning. Now, as schools reopen 
                   for physical attendance, educators, students, and parents are left with a critical question: Should online 
                   education become the new norm?</p>
        
                <p>While virtual learning offers flexibility, reduces travel time, and allows access to courses from across the 
                   globe, in-person education promotes better engagement, hands-on experiences, and social interaction. 
                   Finding the right balance between these two methods could define the future of education.</p>

                <p>Some experts argue that a hybrid model combining the best of both virtual and in-person learning will become 
                   the future of education. However, challenges such as unequal access to technology and the need for digital 
                   literacy must be addressed first.</p>
